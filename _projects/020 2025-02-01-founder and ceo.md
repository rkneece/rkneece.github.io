## Founder and operator.

As a founder, operator, and CEO, I have built and led multiple successful startups, demonstrating a track record of scaling businesses, driving innovation, and fostering high-performing teams. 

At MTC, I bootstrapped the company with an initial investment of just $10,000, transforming it into a multi-million dollar enterprise, twice earning a spot on the Inc. 5000 list as one of America's fastest-growing private companies. Under my leadership, MTC became a recognized leader in SaaS development, data analytics, and data-driven enterprise solutions, serving clients across healthcare, finance, biotechnology, and education. Beyond business growth, I have played a pivotal role in securing millions in funding for startups by leveraging my investor network and technical expertise, helping early-stage companies refine their product strategies, scalability plans, and go-to-market approaches. 

My ability to merge technical execution with strategic vision has resulted in multiple successful exits, including MTCâ€™s acquisition in 2019.

## Building outstanding products.

At [Vocoli](https://www.vocoli.com) (a spin-out of MTC), I led an award-winning HR tech and workforce engagement platform, recognized with the MiTX award for Best Employee Engagement Software. I led product strategy, technical architecture, and go-to-market execution, integrating AI, secure video chat, live streaming, and surveys to enhance employee engagement. 

Vocoli gained enterprise traction and media recognition in Wired, Fast Company, and Forbes.

At HireCentral, I co-founded a leading niche career network in healthcare and life sciences, growing it to 500,000+ monthly visitors through SEO, content-driven marketing, and digital growth strategies. This success led to VC investment from Yahoo/HotJobs and positioned HireCentral as a top industry platform. 

Both ventures showcased my ability to scale businesses, drive innovation, and build high-value digital products.

## My north star.

My north star has always been to build world-class teams that deliver exceptional results by fostering a culture of technical excellence, trust, and psychological safety. 

Because of this, my teams not only meet but exceed expectations in terms of quality, speed, and innovation. Whether as a founder, CEO, or fractional executive, I remain committed to helping organizations scale, innovate, and achieve their highest potential.
