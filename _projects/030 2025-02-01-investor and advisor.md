## Advisory and Fractional CTO

With extensive experience as a founder, a product and engineering leader, and a people leader, I offer advisory and fractional CTO services to startups and scaleups looking to determine product-market fit, stand-up and expand their technology, optimize operations, and build high-performing teams. 

As a two-time Inc. 5000 entrepreneur with successful exits, I understand the challenges of growing a startup and can provide strategic guidance on SaaS scalability, data architecture, AI/ML integration, security compliance, and agile team structuring. My background includes leading distributed teams, streamlining workflows, implementing cloud-based architectures, and driving product innovation across B2B and B2B2C sectors. Whether mentoring founders, securing funding through investor networks, or building engineering cultures that balance speed with quality, I help startups navigate their technology and growth challenges efficiently and cost-effectively.

Some examples of recent engagements include:
- Seed stage HR tech using AI to ensure compensation results in maximum ROI and employee satisfaction
- VC backed deep learning/AI firm involved in legal tech/patents
- Health tech firm using LLMs to better outcomes on clinical notes.
