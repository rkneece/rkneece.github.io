## My professional background

I love building stuff. Full stop. 

**Products, companies, and high performing teams.**

I've had multiple stops as a CTO in scale-up roles, as well as battle scars as a co-founder and operator. I'm proud that my teams have pushed the envelope of innovation, mainly in HR tech and digital health. This includes launching data-centric platforms, applied AI and machine learning, and scalable/secure B2B+2C solutions. But success isn't just about innovative technology. As a people leader, I believe you bring out the best in teams by focusing on empathy, clear paths of communication, individual/team growth and by encouraging psychological safety. 

By doing this, I directly affect the bottom line through high-performing teams that are built to last by caring about the product, the customer and each other. I've been lucky to use my unique background in entrepreneurship, engineering, recruiting, go-to-market, and scaling teams, to build processes and cultures that build cool stuff, while making work fun, reducing churn and improving profitability and long-term success.

Some highlights that have gotten me there:
* I *founded MTC Labs*, which was twice listed in the *Inc 5000* as one of America's fastest growing private firms. We were consistently listed as one of the top professional services firms in New England for our leading UX and engineering engagements, and won multiple awards. We turned a $10 bootstrap into a multi-million dollar agency.
* My tenure as *Eskalera's CTO* was marked by triple-digit multi-year contracts and expansion in 30+ countries (while we tripled team size). We established a powerhouse product engine, delivered unparalleled people analytics insights, and effectively scaled as we grew.
* I co-founded one of the top niche job boards, which focused on healthcare and life sciences. I was even interviewed on outlets such as *CNN, CNBC the Wall Street Journal, Forbes and Wired*.
* Past roles at *Aetna and IBM* have flavored my fundamental belief that strong cultures, a shared vision, and passion in your work impact results and revenues.
* Alumni on my teams have gone onto *engineering and product leadership* roles at companies like Circle, Simplisafe, Workiva, Uber and Netflix. I'm like a proud papa when I see them succeed!

I also have significant experience in highly regulated industries, security and compliance (HIPAA, HITECH, SOC2 Type II, ISO 27001, GDPR, CCPA, HL7 / FHIR).

## Technology in my teams

I focus on technology that meets the moment, and while I have strong opinions, they're loosely held. 

I also don't promote being an expert in every part of the stack, but on having street cred with my team so they can do their jobs. I drive a fundamentally strong bond between product and engineering (with the right amount of friction), combined with aggressive cycle/deployment goals to meet customer needs, modern, serverful+serverless technologies and brilliant data engineering that takes advantage of cutting-edge AI tech.

As a teammate: I get my hands dirty across the stack (especially in data engineering challenges). 
As a customer advocate: I advocate for the end-user through research+understanding+impact. 
As a servant-leader: nothing gives me more satisfaction than building an inclusive team of performers that exceed expectations (and actually enjoy each other).

## Outside of work

I'm a former nationally-ranked bicycle racer. I love bikes, cars and all things sports. I'm a proud dad of two young boys. I'm an admitted gadget lover, and I love drilling holes in walls. Oh, and I fully embrace my dad jokes.
